      <h3>0. Prologue</h3>
      <p class="maintext">This is the story of the road that led me to
        LaunchCode. Like all good stories, there is conflict, betrayal, growth,
        and of course, romance. Yet, this is not a typical adventure story---there
        is no monster lurking in a dark mountain lair, no enemy horde pounding
        at the city gates, no great destiny to fulfill, and the hero's journey
        is not a grand quest for treasure or glory. It is largely the story of
        an ordinary person's internal struggle. Nevertheless, it may be a tale
        worth telling.</p>


        <h3 id="section1">1. Fiat Lux</h3>

        <p class="maintext">As a kid, I did a lot of reading. I mean
          <strong>A LOT</strong> of reading. It was not unusual for me to finish
           an entire 400-500 page book in a day during the summer. Both of my
           parents worked at my school, so I was stuck there even over breaks---the gym and the library were my only options to pass the
           time (it's simple math: a modest income / five kids = no GameBoy).
           Likely as a result of this, when I started at Baylor University in
           fall 2010, I decided to major in English.</p>

        <p class="maintext">At the time, Baylor required all honors program
          freshman to sign up for a first year seminar (essentially, a small,
          one semester course on a special topic). I grew up reading a lot of
          C.S. Lewis, so I chose
          to take a course called "The Philosophy of C.S. Lewis." The course was
          taught by a smart, passionate philosopher trained in the
          <a class="body_links" href="https://www.iep.utm.edu/analytic/" target="_blank">analytic</a>
          tradition, which
          puts a heavy emphasis on careful definition of terms and
          precise, logically valid formulation of arguments. As someone with no
          background in logic at the time (beyond the proofs we all had to do in
           high school geometry), I was deeply impressed by the clarity and force
            of my professor's arguments. Perhaps the more so because these
            arguments were often employed in the systematic destruction of my
             crude Evangelical Christian worldview (but that's a thread of this
             story that I must leave off the loom for now, for the sake of space).</p>

<!-- TODO: Add calvin img link to "mind"  below -->
          <p class="maintext">However, it wasn't only the clarity and power of
            logical argument that gripped me; I found the topics of the course
            fascinating as well---what could be more interesting than thinking
            about <a class="body_links" href="images/calvin-on-god.jpg"
            target="_blank">
              the existence of God</a>, <a class="body_links"

              the nature of <a class="body_links" href="images/calvin-ethics.jpg"

            href=" http://existentialcomics.com/comic/47" target="_blank">
            the (im)materiality of the mind</a>? I quickly decided
            that what I had always been attracted to in English was the
            exploration of philosophical issues such as these. Moreover, I was
            growing tired of the way novelists often raised questions without
            proposing answers. Especially now that the worldview I had grown up
            with had been shattered, I wanted answers---and I was convinced
            studying philosophy would provide them.</p>

          <h3 id="section2">2. Riddles in the Dark</h3>

           <p class="maintext">My first course as a philosophy major was Intro
             to Logic and I loved it. Amidst the truth tables, Venn diagrams,
             and syllogisms, I was at home. I was convinced that this was the
             path for me. Further courses in more advanced logic, philosophy of
             mind, free will, metaphysics, and ethics sealed the deal.</p>

             <p class="maintext">But I was starting to realize that the answers
               I was after would take a lot longer than four years to find. The
               more I learned, the more I realized the vast extent of my
                ignorance. Worse still, the very
              goals and methods of philosophy are themselves a subject of
              serious dispute among philosophers. I became confused even about
              how to search for the answers to philosophical questions,
              in addition to being confused about the answers. The clarity and
              certainty that I
              had hoped for began to seem farther off than when I'd begun
              studying philosophy. In fact, I gave up on ever achieving certainty.
              Or at least, I told myself that I did. I think below the surface,
               I was still driven by a sense that if I just kept studying, I'd
               figure it all out, I'd know what to do, and I could finally go
               about the real business of doing whatever it was I was
               <em>supposed</em>
               to do. Whatever my reasons, I felt compelled to continue studying
               philosophy in a formal setting. I somehow felt that anything else
               would be a betrayal, would show that I was a phony or that I
               didn't <strong>really</strong> care about getting to the truth on
               life's big questions. Thus, I decided to go for my PhD.</p>

              <p class="maintext">Since my then girlfriend (now wife) had gotten
                a job in St. Louis, I applied to PhD programs in philosophy
                here in the Lou. WashU was my first choice, but they put me on
                the waitlist . . .</p><br><br>

            <h4><em>3.1. Despair</em></h4>

            <p class="maintext">My time at SLU started well. I loved learning
              <a class="body_links" href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-modal/"
              target="_blank">modal logic</a> and I felt like my mind was
              running in high gear after every seminar. My favorite moment of
              the day was walking home after classes, the city bathed
              in the golden light of the setting sun and a stream of new ideas
              pouring through my mind in rapid succession.</p>

              <img class="center" src="images/mip_despair.jpg"
              alt="The artist's job is not to give into despair."
              width="400" style="float: left;">
<!-- TODO: Fill out/clarify this transition -->
            <p class="maintext">Yet beneath my pursuit of philosophy, there were
               deep fault lines. I had false assumptions about the discipline
               and problematic motives for pursuing it as a profession that were
               rooted in deep issues of identity and soon
              these fault lines would begin to cause cracks in the surface of my
              life.</p>

              <p class="maintext">Before long, I discovered that the academic
                life was not what I'd thought it would be.
               Instead of spending my time learning about interesting subjects
               through deep discussions with friends, I found myself sitting
               alone, reading about
               technical issues seven steps of abstraction removed from
               anything I cared about and learning next to nothing. The reasons
               for this are a complex of hyperspecialization and the publish-or-
               perish atmosphere, which have the effect that people think about
               what they can publish on, not what they care about; that people
               can rarely have productive conversations, as even other
               philosophers likely don't
               have a sufficient grasp of one's area of research to speak
               meaningfully about it; and that one must read and write so much,
               that it is difficult to maintain one's health and friendships. I
               felt like I was
               spinning my wheels, only digging myself deeper in a hole of doubt
                and confusion, multiplying and sophisticating the questions, but
               getting no closer to answering them---and on top of this entering
               a career that promised what seemed to me to be a fairly pathetic
               existence.</p>

                 <p class="maintext">Yet the second fault line was perhaps even
                   more destructive. I told myself I was pursuing the truth
                   for its own sake, simply because I found the questions
                   interesing and the study rewarding. But I think I was also,
                   perhaps mostly, motivated by a desire to be the guy with the
                   answers. I've always succeeded academically and that has been
                   the thing I've received the most praise and recognition for.
                   Somehow, I got to the point where my identity as a smart
                   person (which I thought of, foolishly, as being a sort of "whiz"
                   kid, able to rattle off the answer to any question posed), was my only identity or at least
                    my most fundamental identity. As I came to realize how much
                    I did not know, especially about such important questions, I
                    began to feel a need, a compulsion to find the answers. After
                    all, I was the guy who knows things, the guy with answers.
                    If there were important questions that I couldn't answer,
                    then who was I? Why would anyone find me interesting or my
                    company worthwhile? This compulsion brought on by the conflict
                    between my identity on the one hand, and the reality of my
                    ignorance and inability to remove it on the other, magnified
                    the normal stressors of graduate school and led me to have
                    unrealistic expectations of what it would be like to be a
                    professional philosopher. Every stupid question, every bad
                    paper, every new realization of how much I didn't understand
                    was not just a part of the normal growing pains of a young
                    philosopher; it was a challenge to my conception of myself
                    and my value as a person. </p>

                    <p class="maintext">All this was compounded by (i) a serious case of
                      imposter syndrome, (ii) being thrown into teaching my own class
                      with little training and no mentorship, (iii) by
                    my best friend and climbing partner moving away, and (iv) by my
                    wife's work environment turning out to be extremely toxic. Taken
                    together,
                    these factors led me to a very dark place. I woke up every day
                    and hoped I'd be sick so I could cancel my class and just stay
                    home. I tried to avoid
                     seeing anyone from my department because I was ashamed that I
                     was struggling, ashamed I wasn't a true philosopher. I
                     couldn't break out of negative patterns
                      of thought and I felt like a complete failure. My life
                      seemed to be falling apart and I had a hard time believing
                      things would ever get better.</p>

                 <h4><em>3.2. And Back Again</em></h4>
                 <p class="maintext">Sometimes we have to hit rock bottom before
                   we can give up our false beliefs and harmful values, or
                   even see that we have them. I finally got to the
                    point where I knew something had to give and I had to admit
                    to myself that my pursuit of philosophy was not a noble
                    pursuit of truth for truth's sake. This insight into my true
                    motives and misconceptions was one part of a radical shift
                    in perspective that has helped me climb back out of the
                    black pit I was in emotionally. But perhaps the most
                    important factor the experience of real love
                    and belonging through my wife and her family.</p>

                    <img class="center" src="images/mip_love.jpg"
                    alt="Hemingway: Love provides a respite from death; cowardice
                    is rooted in a failure to love or love well." width="400"
                    style="float: right;">

                  <p class="maintext">My parents were good to me and raised me
                  pretty well. I was a well-behaved, conscientious kid and a
                good student and I didn't make any enormously bad decisions as a
                teen. But I never really learned how to love people. The exact
              reasons for this are not clear to me, and I do not have the space
              to explore them here anyway, but whatever the reasons, my family
              and I were not close. As a result, I think I was emotionally
              stunted and self-focused. I generally acted in a kind way towards
              others because I knew it was
              the right thing to do and I wanted to be a good person, but I
              didn't experience a deep sense of
              empathy for others, at least not usually. There was a central,
              phenomenological aspect of love that was absent. Perhaps you could
              say that I acted for the good of others out of duty, rather than
              desire, or that I did things for others because I wanted to be
              good, not because I wanted <em>their</em> good. My love was an
              intellectualist, rather cold sort of concern, rather than the
              holistic, personal sort that I take to constitute love, at least
              in its ideal form.</p>
              <p class="maintext">My wife, on the otherhand, comes from a
                boisterous, close-knit Italian family that really
                knows how to love. They're a bit rough around the edges, maybe
                not so good at strict adherence to rules, but they deeply care
                about others and want the good for them. They might let their
                emotions flare a bit more than they should, but they convey such
                 a sense of grace
                 and acceptance that when they argue or wrong one another, it
                 never fractures the relationship, but only strengthens it.
                 As I spent a few summers and many holidays with this incredible
                 family, I began to see the value of the domestic life for the
                 first time and I began to see the world as a member of this
                 family. As I grew closer to my
                 wife, I also began to see the world as a husband and (aspiring)
                 father. That is to say, being a member of this family and being
                 a husband and (aspiring) father became a part of my <span style="color: #9f9fdf"

                 target="_blank">Christine Korsgaard</a>. As these new identities developed
                 and my old identity faded, I realized that I no longer wanted a
                 career in philosophy for three reasons:</p><br>
                   <ol>
                     <li>The academic life was not a good fit for my skills and
                       interests.</li>
                     <li>The academic life would very likely not allow my wife
                       and I to raise our (future) kids near family.</li>
                    <li>The academic life would not allow us to contribute to
                      our families/care for our relatives as they age.</li>
                   </ol><br>
                 <p class="maintext">In light of these reasons, I decided to walk away from
                 philosophy and pursue a career that would have more concrete
                 results/feedback and direct benefits to others, as well as one
                 with better pay and greater control over where I would live.</p>

                 <p class="maintext">Based on these criteria plus my background and skills in
                 argumentation and analysis, law seemed a natural fit. But, I
                 knew a couple of guys who work in software development and they
                 suggested that I look into that as well. After reasearching a
                 bit, I decided to apply to LaunchCode and try to work as a
                 programmer for a year before law school for a number of reasons:</p><br>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Coding is intrinsically interesting.</li>
                      <li>Coding will open up opportunities in IP law and the
                        emerging

                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFGOcz57QB8"
                         target="_blank">legal tech</a> field.</li>
                      <li>Part of me hopes that I can make a career of coding,
                        so that I don't have to go to school for three more
                        years.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                <p class="maintext">After several anxious weeks of waiting, I got my acceptance
                email from LaunchCode and dove right in to learning to code.
                Three months later and I'd say it's the best decision I've made
                since marrying my wife---I'm happier, more driven, and more
                hopeful than I've ever been. The journey to this place was difficult,
                painful, and disorienting, yet full of beauty and insight
                and growth---that is to say, it's been an adventure. And
               like all great adventures, you never know exactly what lies ahead.</p>

                   Let others follow, if they can!<br>
                   Let them a journey new begin.<br>
