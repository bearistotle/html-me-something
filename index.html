        <h3>0. Prologue</h3>
        <p class="maintext">This is the story of the road that led me here. By 'here,' I mean
          'this place in
          my life' or better 'this set of goals and commitments.' Like all good
          stories, there is conflict, betrayal, growth, and of course, romance.
          Yet, this is not a typical adventure story; there is no monster lurking
          in a dark dungeon far across the land, no enemy horde pounding at the
          city gates, no great destiny to fulfill, and the hero's quest is not
          for some grand treasure or heroic feat. The villains of this story are
          despair, falsehood, and phobia, and the hero's quest is not for glory,
          but for truth and virtue. Nevertheless, it may be a tale worth telling.

        <h3 id="section1">1. Fiat Lux</h3>

        <p class="maintext">As a kid, I did a lot of reading. I mean <strong>A LOT</strong> of
          reading. It was not unusual for me to finish an entire 400-500 page book
          in a day during the summer. Both of my parents worked at my school, so I
          was stuck there even over breaks---the gym and the library were about my
          only options to pass the time (a modest income / five kids = no GameBoy).
          Likely as a result of this, when I started at Baylor University in
          fall 2010, I decided to major in English.</p>

          <!-- Insert some images of favorite childhood books -->

        <p class="maintext">At the time, Baylor required all honors program freshman to sign up for
          a first year seminar (essentially, a small, one semester course on a
          special topic). I grew up reading a lot of C.S. Lewis, so I chose
          to take a course called "The Philosophy of C.S. Lewis." The course was
          taught by a sharp, passionate philosopher trained in the
          <a href="https://www.iep.utm.edu/analytic/" target="_blank">analytic</a> tradition, which
          puts a heavy emphasis on careful definition of terms and
          precise, logical formulation of arguments. As someone with no background
          in logic (beyond the proofs we all had to do in high school geometry) I
          was deeply impressed by the clarity and force of my professor's arguments.
          Perhaps the more so because these arguments were often employed in the
          systematic destruction of my crude Evangelical Christian worldview
          (but that is a thread of this story that I must leave out for now, for
          lack of space and time).</p>

          <p class="maintext">However, it wasn't just the clarity and power of logical argument
            that gripped me; I found the topics of the course fascinating as
            well. The existence of God, free will, the source and content of our
             moral obligations,
            the nature of rational belief and evidence, the materiality of the
            mind---the course really was a whirlwind tour through
            the deep questions of life with Lewis's work as our starting point. I
            decided that what I had always been attracted to in English was the
            exploration of philosophical issues. Moreover, I was growing tired of
            writers "exploring" questions and never actually attempting to answer
            them.
            Especially now that the worldview I had grown up with had been
            shattered, I wanted answers. And I was convinced studying philosophy
            could give them to me.</p>

          <h3 id="section2">2. Riddles in the Dark</h3>

           <p class="maintext">My first course as a philosophy major was Intro to Logic (or "baby
             logic" as one of my profs called it) and I loved it. Amidst the truth
             tables, Euler circles, and syllogisms, I was home. I was convinced that
             this was the path for me. Further courses in more advanced logic,
             philosophy of mind, free will, metaphysics, and ethics just sealed the
             deal.</p>

             <p class="maintext">But I was starting to realize that the answers I was after would
             take a lot longer than four years to find. The more I learned, the more
              I realized the vast extent of my ignorance. Worse still, the very
              goals and methods of philosophy are themselves a subject of
              serious dispute among philosophers. The clarity and certainty that I
              had hoped for began to seem farther off than when I'd begun
              studying philosophy. In fact, I gave up on ever achieving certainty.
              Or at least, I told myself that I did. I think below the surface,
               I was still driven by a sense that if I just kept studying, I'd
               figure it all out, I'd know what to do, and I could finally go
               about the real business of doing whatever it was I was supposed
               to do. Whatever my reasons, I felt compelled to continue studying
               philosophy in a formal setting. I somehow felt that anything else
               would be a betrayal, would show that I was a phony, that I didn't
               really love the truth. Thus,
              I decided to go for my PhD.</p>

              <p class="maintext">Since my then girlfriend (now wife) had gotten a job with Teach
                for America in St. Louis, I
              applied to PhD programs in philosophy here in the Lou. WashU was my
              first choice, but they waitlisted me . . .</p><br><br>

            <h4><em>3.1. Despair</em></h4>
<!-- TODO: talk about Jerry leaving as betrayal, as contributing to loneliness, etc. -->
            <p class="maintext">My time at SLU started well. I loved learning modal logic and I
              felt like my mind was running in high gear after every seminar. My
              favorite moment of the day was walking home at the end of the day,
              the city bathed in the golden light of the setting sun, a stream of
              new ideas pouring through my mind in rapid succession.</p>

            <p class="maintext">Yet my pursuit of philosophy was undergirded by false assumptions
               and unhealthy motives, and soon, the cracks began to form. The
               academic life was not what I had thought it would be. Instead of
               spending my time discussing interesting questions with friends,
               I found myself sitting alone, reading about technical questions
               seven steps of abstraction removed from anything I cared about.
               The publish-or-perish atmosphere and the terrible job market
               have pushed the discipline in a soul-crushingly corporate direction.
               Moreover, I felt like I was spinning my wheels, only digging
               myself deeper in a hole of questions, multiplying and
               sophisticating the questions, but never answering them. Truth be
               told, I think a part of the reason that I got into philosophy was
               that I enjoyed feeling intellectually superior to others and I
               never wanted to have my worldview pulled out from under me as I
               had in that Philosophy of C.S. Lewis class. The embarrassment of
               having my ignorance and irrationality publicly exposed left deeper
                psychological scars than I had thought.</p>

              <p class="maintext">All of this contributed to some serious impostor syndrome, which,
                coupled with the isolation, long hours, and poor habits of eating,
                sleeping, and exercise that graduate school encourages, led me to
                a very dark place emotionally. I woke up every day and hoped I'd
                be sick so I could just stay home. I tried to avoid seeing anyone
                 from my department. I struggled to break out of negative patterns
                 of thought and felt like a complete failure. I felt like my life
                 was falling apart and I had a hard time believing things would
                 ever get better.</p>
                 <h4><em>3.2. And Back Again</em></h4>
                 <p class="maintext">Sometimes we have to hit rock bottom before we can give up
                   some of our false beliefs about what matters in life, or even
                    recognize that we have them sometimes. I finally got to the
                    point where I knew something had to give and I had to admit
                    to myself that my pursuit of philosophy was not a noble
                    pursuit of truth for truth's sake. I was pursuing certainty
                    out of fear of being wrong about the important questions in
                    life. I was pursuing an unconquerable rational defense of my
                    beliefs out of a fear of being embarrassed again. I was
                    pursuing understanding, yes, not for its own sake, but for the
                    sake of feeling intellectually superior and for the sake of
                    having something that others might want. And in part, I was
                    pursuing the respect and recognition of the elders of my
                    tribe so to speak. Boys generally crave validation from the
                    established men in their community, which in my case meant
                    the better professors in the philosophy department. This
                    natural tendency was ramped up in me because I did not have
                    a great relationship with my father (he was not an alcoholic
                    or abusive or anything---just critical and hard to connect
                    with). Because I so craved recognition from the professors
                    whom I admired, I felt I had to become an excellent
                    philosopher. Somehow, I thought that if I did something else
                    with my life, and especially, if I quit grad school, I would
                    be letting them down and losing their respect. This is, of
                    course, silly. They all recognize that professional
                    philosophy is not for everyone and that there are many other
                    good lives and (far more) useful professions. Moreover, they
                    probably barely remember me and wouldn't give it a second
                    thought if they heard that I quit!
                  </p>
                  <p class="maintext">As I said before, I experienced a radical shift in
                    perspective, which had two causes. The newfound insight into
                    my own mind was the first, but that took quite a while to
                    come to light---in fact, I am still discovering some of
                    this as I write. As I was developing this insight, I was
                    also being changed by the love of my wife and her family.</p>
                  <p class="maintext">My wife. . . </p>
                  <img class="center" src="images/mip_love.jpg"
                  alt="Hemingway: Love provides a respite from death; cowardice
                  is rooted in a failure to love or love well." width="400">


              <p class="maintext">the rigors of graduate work, the isolation of
              moving to a new city, and the toxic atmosphere of academia began to
              take a serious toll. I had so much reading to do, that I felt I
              didn't have time to exercise, which meant that I had no healthy way
              of dealing with stress, and, since I didn't attend church, it meant
              that my primary way of making and developing friendships was gone.
              The graduate school was my only source of community and the other
              students were also extremely busy and largely did not share my
              interests. So, I was holed up alone, reading and writing all day,
              every day. To make things worse, the job market for philosophy PhDs
              is <strong>abysmal</strong>, so there is incredible pressure to
              publish while in graduate school and to impress professors, so they
              will want to advise your dissertation and write you a sparkling
              recommendation. This, combined with the lack of community and my
              innate perfectionism and insecurity, made me feel like I needed to
              get everything right and develop genuinely new and insightful views
              in all of my papers and never say anything wrong or ask any stupid
              questions. Unsurprisingly, this made it very difficult for me to
              get to know my professors and to write my papers and to participate
              in class discussions. And of course, this only led me to feel more
              self-conscious, more isolated, and so more pressure to perform. It
              was a truly sick cycle. Worse still, I was thrown into teaching my
              own course my freshman year with very little training or support.
              So the guilt of failing my students and being a terrible teacher,
              plus the extra work of writing (and practicing) lectures and grading
               was thrown into the mix.</p>

                 <p class="maintext">About two years into my graduate program, I began to realize that
                 the academic life was not for me. I didn't have the scholar's
                 drive to devote my life to giving a systematic answer to a small
                 question. I didn't even enjoy teaching philosophy, at least as it
                 is done in the university setting. And I had begun to think about
                 things not from the unencumbered and uncommitted position of a
                 single person with no debt and no real relationship with his
                 family, but from the pressing position of a husband, a future
                 father, and a member of a real, loving family. My wife's family
                 took me in as their own and showed me what a beautiful thing a
                 good family is. I had come to see that much of what I was seeking
                 in philosophy was trying to fill a relational or communal void in
                 my life and also that the sort of career I could plausibly look
                 forward to in academia (if any) would not allow me to live up to
                 my duties as a member of my wife's family, nor would it allow me
                 and my wife to achieve our desires for our own family. We felt we
                 would need to contribute to the care of some of the aging members
                 of her family in the near future, and we wanted to raise our
                 kids around their extended family. Thus, we realized that we
                 needed a better income and more control over job location than a
                 career in philosophy could promise. So, I began exploring other
                 options. Law was a logical shift, as the skills of analysis and
                 argumentation that one learns in philosophy directly translate to
                 the practice of law. But I knew a couple of people who work in
                 software engineering, one of whom left philosophy to do so, and
                 they encouraged me to look into coding. The more I learned about
                 what coding involved, the more interested I became. Now that I've
                 been learning to code for a few weeks, I am hooked. I love the
                 concreteness of functions and programs. They work or they don't.
                 And if they don't, you know there is a way to fix them. And
                 everything is so logical and so useful. The definitiveness, the
                 ability to test my work, and the utility of the work makes coding
                 deeply rewarding.</p>

                 <p class="maintext">After completing LC101, I'm hoping to get placed in an
                   apprenticeship in Saint Louis, that turns into a real job for
                   the next year. I still want to go to law school after that,
                   but I have become convinced that the legal field is on the
                   brink of being revolutionized through software. I think the
                   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFGOcz57QB8"
                    target="_blank">legal tech</a> field holds promise of
                    financial reward, stimulating work, and the chance to make the
                    world a significantly more just place. So, I'm hoping that I
                    get to keep coding and help bring cheaper
                    and better legal service to more people.</p> <!-- maybe add stuff
                      about how the bail project and Mike Huemer's blog helped
                      you see that the cost of legal services/the inadequate
                      provision of them is perhaps THE central injustice of our
                      society --> <p class="maintext">The journey to this place was difficult,
                      painful, and disorienting, yet full of beauty and insight
                      and growth---that is to say, it's been an adventure. And
                     like all great adventures, you never know exactly what lies
                   ahead. </p>

                   <p class="stanza">The Road goes ever on and on<br>
                   Out from the door where it began.<br>
                   Now far ahead the Road has gone.<br>
                   Let others follow, if they can!<br>
                   Let them a journey new begin.<br>
                   But I at last with weary feet<br>
                   Will turn towards the lighted inn,<br>
                   My evening-rest and sleep to meet.<br><br>

                  Still 'round the corner there may wait<br>
                  A new road or secret gate;<br>
                  And though I oft have passed them by,<br>
                  A day will come at last when I<br>
                  Shall take the hidden paths that run<br>
                  West of the Moon, East of the Sun.</p>
