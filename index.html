        <h3>0. Prologue</h3>
        <p class="maintext">This is the story of the road that led me to
          LaunchCode. Like all good
          stories, there is conflict, betrayal, growth, and of course, romance.
          Yet, this is not a typical adventure story; there is no monster lurking
          in a dark dungeon, no enemy horde pounding at the
          city gates, no great destiny to fulfill, and the hero's journey is not
          for a grand quest for treasure or glory. The villains of this story are
          vices, in particular, despair and blindness of mind, and the hero's
          quest is for what Aquinas called "the theological virtues"---faith,
          hope, and love. Nevertheless, it may be a tale worth telling.</p><br>

        <h3 id="section1">1. Fiat Lux</h3>

        <p class="maintext">As a kid, I did a lot of reading. I mean
          <strong>A LOT</strong> of reading. It was not unusual for me to finish
           an entire 400-500 page book in a day during the summer. Both of my
           parents worked at my school, so I was stuck there even over breaks
           ---the gym and the library were my only options to pass the
           time (it's simple math: a modest income / five kids = no GameBoy).
           Likely as a result of this, when I started at Baylor University in
           fall 2010, I decided to major in English.</p>

        </iframe>

        <p class="maintext">At the time, Baylor required all honors program
          freshman to sign up for a first year seminar (essentially, a small,
          one semester course on a special topic). I grew up reading a lot of
          C.S. Lewis, so I chose
          to take a course called "The Philosophy of C.S. Lewis." The course was
          taught by a smart, passionate philosopher trained in the
          <a class="body_links" href="https://www.iep.utm.edu/analytic/" target="_blank">analytic</a>
          tradition, which
          puts a heavy emphasis on careful definition of terms and
          precise, logically valid formulation of arguments. As someone with no
          background in logic at the time (beyond the proofs we all had to do in
           high school geometry) I was deeply impressed by the clarity and force
            of my professor's arguments. Perhaps the more so because these
            arguments were often employed in the systematic destruction of my
             crude Evangelical Christian worldview (but that's a thread of this
             story that I must leave off the loom for now, for the sake of space
             ).</p>

<!-- TODO: Add calvin img links to p below -->
          <p class="maintext">However, it wasn't only the clarity and power of
            logical argument that gripped me; I found the topics of the course
            fascinating as well---what could be more interesting than thinking
            about the existence of God, free will, the nature of morality and
            rationality, and the (im)materiality of the mind? I quickly decided
            that what I had always been attracted to in English was the
            exploration of philosophical issues such as these. Moreover, I was
            growing tired of the way novelists often raised questions without
            proposing answers. Especially now that the worldview I had grown up
            with had been shattered, I wanted answers---and I was convinced
            studying philosophy would provide them.</p>

          <h3 id="section2">2. Riddles in the Dark</h3>

           <p class="maintext">My first course as a philosophy major was Intro
             to Logic and I loved it. Amidst the truth tables, Venn diagrams,
             and syllogisms, I was at home. I was convinced that this was the
             path for me. Further courses in more advanced logic, philosophy of
             mind, free will, metaphysics, and ethics sealed the deal.</p>

             <p class="maintext">But I was starting to realize that the answers
               I was after would take a lot longer than four years to find. The
               more I learned, the more I realized the vast extent of my
                ignorance. Worse still, the very
              goals and methods of philosophy are themselves a subject of
              serious dispute among philosophers. I became confused even about
              how to go about finding the answers to philosophical questions,
              in addition to being confused about the answers. The clarity and
              certainty that I
              had hoped for began to seem farther off than when I'd begun
              studying philosophy. In fact, I gave up on ever achieving certainty.
              Or at least, I told myself that I did. I think below the surface,
               I was still driven by a sense that if I just kept studying, I'd
               figure it all out, I'd know what to do, and I could finally go
               about the real business of doing whatever it was I was
               <em>supposed</em>
               to do. Whatever my reasons, I felt compelled to continue studying
               philosophy in a formal setting. I somehow felt that anything else
               would be a betrayal, would show that I was a phony or that I
               didn't <strong>really</strong> care about getting to the truth on
               life's big questions. Thus, I decided to go for my PhD.</p>

              <p class="maintext">Since my then girlfriend (now wife) had gotten
                a job in St. Louis, I applied to PhD programs in philosophy
                here in the Lou. WashU was my first choice, but they waitlisted
                me . . .</p><br><br>

            <h4><em>3.1. Despair</em></h4>
<!-- TODO: talk about Jerry leaving as betrayal, as contributing to loneliness, etc. -->
            <p class="maintext">My time at SLU started well. I loved learning
              <a class="body_links" href="https://www.coopertoons.com/education/modallogic/modallogic.html"
              target="_blank">modal logic</a> and I felt like my mind was
              running in high gear after every seminar. My favorite moment of
              the day was walking home after classes, the city bathed
              in the golden light of the setting sun and a stream of new ideas
              pouring through my mind in rapid succession.</p>

              <img class="center" src="images/mip_despair.jpg"
              alt="The artist's job is not to give into despair."
              width="400" style="float: left;"><br><br>

            <p class="maintext">Yet beneath my pursuit of philosophy were fault
              lines constituted by false assumptions and unhealthy motives; soon,
              the effects of these fault lines began to show on the surface.
              For one thing, the academic life was not what I had thought it would be.
               Instead of spending my time learning about interesting subjects
               through deep discussions with friends, I found myself sitting
               alone, reading about
               technical issues seven steps of abstraction removed from
               anything I cared about and learning next to nothing. The reasons
               for this are a complex of hyperspecialization and the publish-or-
               perish atmosphere, which have the effect that people think about what they can publish
               on, not what they care about; that people can rarely have
               productive conversations, as even other philosophers likely don't
               have a sufficient grasp of one's area of research to speak
               meaningfully about it; and that one must read and write so much,
               that it is difficult to maintain one's health and friendships.
               Magnifying all this is a professionalized culture in the discipline
               in which everyone reads a few big names, while the work of most
               goes unread and unappreciated. Since the undergrads one teaches
               by and large do not care about the subject, this means that for
               most academic philosophers, most of their work seems to them to
               be either underappreciated (leading to bitterness) or unworthy
               (leading to low self-worth). I felt like I was
               spinning my wheels, only digging myself deeper in a hole of doubt
                and confusion, multiplying and sophisticating the questions, but
               getting no closer to answering them---and on top of this entering
               a career that promised only a pathetic and miserable obscurity.
               All this was compounded by a serious case of imposter syndrome,
               my best friend and climbing partner moving away, and my wife also
               being in a graduate program. Taken together, these factors led me
               to a very dark place. I woke up every day and hoped I'd
                be sick so I could just stay home. I tried to avoid seeing anyone
                 from my department. I struggled to break out of negative patterns
                 of thought and felt like a complete failure. I felt like my life
                 was falling apart and I had a hard time believing things would
                 ever get better.</p>
                 <h4><em>3.2. And Back Again</em></h4>
                 <!-- TODO: Finish editing text below here -->
                 <p class="maintext">Sometimes we have to hit rock bottom before we can give up
                   some of our false beliefs about what matters in life, or even
                    recognize that we have them sometimes. I finally got to the
                    point where I knew something had to give and I had to admit
                    to myself that my pursuit of philosophy was not a noble
                    pursuit of truth for truth's sake. I was pursuing certainty
                    out of fear of being wrong about the important questions in
                    life. I was pursuing an unconquerable rational defense of my
                    beliefs out of a fear of being embarrassed again. I was
                    pursuing understanding, yes, not for its own sake, but for the
                    sake of feeling intellectually superior and for the sake of
                    having something that others might want. And in part, I was
                    pursuing the respect and recognition of the elders of my
                    tribe so to speak. Boys generally crave validation from the
                    established men in their community, which in my case meant
                    the better professors in the philosophy department. This
                    natural tendency was ramped up in me because I did not have
                    a great relationship with my father (he was not an alcoholic
                    or abusive or anything---just critical and hard to connect
                    with). Because I so craved recognition from the professors
                    whom I admired, I felt I had to become an excellent
                    philosopher. Somehow, I thought that if I did something else
                    with my life, and especially, if I quit grad school, I would
                    be letting them down and losing their respect. This is, of
                    course, silly. They all recognize that professional
                    philosophy is not for everyone and that there are many other
                    good lives and (far more) useful professions. Moreover, they
                    probably barely remember me and wouldn't give it a second
                    thought if they heard that I quit!
                  </p>
                  <p class="maintext">As I said before, I experienced a radical shift in
                    perspective, which had two causes. The newfound insight into
                    my own mind was the first, but that took quite a while to
                    come to light---in fact, I am still discovering some of
                    this as I write. As I was developing this insight, I was
                    also being changed by the love of my wife and her family.</p>
                  <p class="maintext">My wife. . . </p>

                  is rooted in a failure to love or love well." width="400"
                  style="float: right;">


              <p class="maintext">the rigors of graduate work, the isolation of
              moving to a new city, and the toxic atmosphere of academia began to
              take a serious toll. I had so much reading to do, that I felt I
              didn't have time to exercise, which meant that I had no healthy way
              of dealing with stress, and, since I didn't attend church, it meant
              that my primary way of making and developing friendships was gone.
              The graduate school was my only source of community and the other
              students were also extremely busy and largely did not share my
              interests. So, I was holed up alone, reading and writing all day,
              every day. To make things worse, the job market for philosophy PhDs
              is <strong>abysmal</strong>, so there is incredible pressure to
              publish while in graduate school and to impress professors, so they
              will want to advise your dissertation and write you a sparkling
              recommendation. This, combined with the lack of community and my
              innate perfectionism and insecurity, made me feel like I needed to
              get everything right and develop genuinely new and insightful views
              in all of my papers and never say anything wrong or ask any stupid
              questions. Unsurprisingly, this made it very difficult for me to
              get to know my professors and to write my papers and to participate
              in class discussions. And of course, this only led me to feel more
              self-conscious, more isolated, and so more pressure to perform. It
              was a truly sick cycle. Worse still, I was thrown into teaching my
              own course my freshman year with very little training or support.
              So the guilt of failing my students and being a terrible teacher,
              plus the extra work of writing (and practicing) lectures and grading
               was thrown into the mix.</p>

                 <p class="maintext">About two years into my graduate program, I began to realize that
                 the academic life was not for me. I didn't have the scholar's
                 drive to devote my life to giving a systematic answer to a small
                 question. I didn't even enjoy teaching philosophy, at least as it
                 is done in the university setting. And I had begun to think about
                 things not from the unencumbered and uncommitted position of a
                 single person with no debt and no real relationship with his
                 family, but from the pressing position of a husband, a future
                 father, and a member of a real, loving family. My wife's family
                 took me in as their own and showed me what a beautiful thing a
                 good family is. I had come to see that much of what I was seeking
                 in philosophy was trying to fill a relational or communal void in
                 my life and also that the sort of career I could plausibly look
                 forward to in academia (if any) would not allow me to live up to
                 my duties as a member of my wife's family, nor would it allow me
                 and my wife to achieve our desires for our own family. We felt we
                 would need to contribute to the care of some of the aging members
                 of her family in the near future, and we wanted to raise our
                 kids around their extended family. Thus, we realized that we
                 needed a better income and more control over job location than a
                 career in philosophy could promise. So, I began exploring other
                 options. Law was a logical shift, as the skills of analysis and
                 argumentation that one learns in philosophy directly translate to
                 the practice of law.</p>


                 <p class="maintext">But I knew a couple of people who work in
                 software engineering, one of whom left philosophy to do so, and
                 they encouraged me to look into coding. The more I learned about
                 what coding involved, the more interested I became. Now that I've
                 been learning to code for a few weeks, I am hooked. I love the
                 concreteness of functions and programs. They work or they don't.
                 And if they don't, you know there is a way to fix them. And
                 everything is so logical and so useful. The definitiveness, the
                 ability to test my work, and the utility of the work makes coding
                 deeply rewarding.</p>

                 <p class="maintext">After completing LC101, I'm hoping to get placed in an
                   apprenticeship in Saint Louis, that turns into a real job for
                   the next year. I still want to go to law school after that,
                   but I have become convinced that the legal field is on the
                   brink of being revolutionized through software. I think the
                   <a class="body_links" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFGOcz57QB8"
                    target="_blank">legal tech</a> field holds promise of
                    financial reward, stimulating work, and the chance to make the
                    world a significantly more just place. So, I'm hoping that I
                    get to keep coding and help bring cheaper
                    and better legal service to more people.</p> <!-- maybe add stuff
                      about how the bail project and Mike Huemer's blog helped
                      you see that the cost of legal services/the inadequate
                      provision of them is perhaps THE central injustice of our
                      society --> <p class="maintext">The journey to this place was difficult,
                      painful, and disorienting, yet full of beauty and insight
                      and growth---that is to say, it's been an adventure. And
                     like all great adventures, you never know exactly what lies
                   ahead. </p>

                   Out from the door where it began.<br>
                   Now far ahead the Road has gone.<br>
                   Let others follow, if they can!<br>
