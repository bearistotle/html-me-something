        <h3>0. Prologue</h3>
        <p class="maintext">This is the story of the road that led me to
          LaunchCode. Like all good
          stories, there is conflict, betrayal, growth, and of course, romance.
          Yet, this is not a typical adventure story; there is no monster lurking
          in a dark dungeon, no enemy horde pounding at the
          city gates, no great destiny to fulfill, and the hero's journey is not
          for a grand quest for treasure or glory. The villains of this story are
          vices, in particular, despair and blindness of mind, and the hero's
          quest is for what Aquinas called "the theological virtues"---faith,
          hope, and love. Nevertheless, it may be a tale worth telling.</p><br>

        <h3 id="section1">1. Fiat Lux</h3>

        <p class="maintext">As a kid, I did a lot of reading. I mean
          <strong>A LOT</strong> of reading. It was not unusual for me to finish
           an entire 400-500 page book in a day during the summer. Both of my
           parents worked at my school, so I was stuck there even over breaks
           ---the gym and the library were my only options to pass the
           time (it's simple math: a modest income / five kids = no GameBoy).
           Likely as a result of this, when I started at Baylor University in
           fall 2010, I decided to major in English.</p>

        <p class="maintext">At the time, Baylor required all honors program
          freshman to sign up for a first year seminar (essentially, a small,
          one semester course on a special topic). I grew up reading a lot of
          C.S. Lewis, so I chose
          to take a course called "The Philosophy of C.S. Lewis." The course was
          taught by a smart, passionate philosopher trained in the
          <a class="body_links" href="https://www.iep.utm.edu/analytic/" target="_blank">analytic</a>
          tradition, which
          puts a heavy emphasis on careful definition of terms and
          precise, logically valid formulation of arguments. As someone with no
          background in logic at the time (beyond the proofs we all had to do in
           high school geometry) I was deeply impressed by the clarity and force
            of my professor's arguments. Perhaps the more so because these
            arguments were often employed in the systematic destruction of my
             crude Evangelical Christian worldview (but that's a thread of this
             story that I must leave off the loom for now, for the sake of space
             ).</p>

<!-- TODO: Add calvin img link to "mind"  below -->
          <p class="maintext">However, it wasn't only the clarity and power of
            logical argument that gripped me; I found the topics of the course
            fascinating as well---what could be more interesting than thinking
            about <a class="body_links" href="images/calvin-on-god.jpg"
            target="_blank">
              the existence of God</a>, <a class="body_links"
              href="images/calvin-fatalism.jpg" target="_blank">free will</a>,
              the nature of <a class="body_links" href="images/calvin-ethics.jpg"
              target="_blank">morality</a> and
            <a class="body_links" href="calvin-reason.jpg"
            target="_blank">rationality</a>, and the (im)materiality of the mind? I quickly decided
            that what I had always been attracted to in English was the
            exploration of philosophical issues such as these. Moreover, I was
            growing tired of the way novelists often raised questions without
            proposing answers. Especially now that the worldview I had grown up
            with had been shattered, I wanted answers---and I was convinced
            studying philosophy would provide them.</p>

          <h3 id="section2">2. Riddles in the Dark</h3>

           <p class="maintext">My first course as a philosophy major was Intro
             to Logic and I loved it. Amidst the truth tables, Venn diagrams,
             and syllogisms, I was at home. I was convinced that this was the
             path for me. Further courses in more advanced logic, philosophy of
             mind, free will, metaphysics, and ethics sealed the deal.</p>

             <p class="maintext">But I was starting to realize that the answers
               I was after would take a lot longer than four years to find. The
               more I learned, the more I realized the vast extent of my
                ignorance. Worse still, the very
              goals and methods of philosophy are themselves a subject of
              serious dispute among philosophers. I became confused even about
              how to search for the answers to philosophical questions,
              in addition to being confused about the answers. The clarity and
              certainty that I
              had hoped for began to seem farther off than when I'd begun
              studying philosophy. In fact, I gave up on ever achieving certainty.
              Or at least, I told myself that I did. I think below the surface,
               I was still driven by a sense that if I just kept studying, I'd
               figure it all out, I'd know what to do, and I could finally go
               about the real business of doing whatever it was I was
               <em>supposed</em>
               to do. Whatever my reasons, I felt compelled to continue studying
               philosophy in a formal setting. I somehow felt that anything else
               would be a betrayal, would show that I was a phony or that I
               didn't <strong>really</strong> care about getting to the truth on
               life's big questions. Thus, I decided to go for my PhD.</p>

              <p class="maintext">Since my then girlfriend (now wife) had gotten
                a job in St. Louis, I applied to PhD programs in philosophy
                here in the Lou. WashU was my first choice, but they put me on
                the waitlist . . .</p><br><br>

            <h4><em>3.1. Despair</em></h4>

            <p class="maintext">My time at SLU started well. I loved learning
              <a class="body_links" href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-modal/"
              target="_blank">modal logic</a> and I felt like my mind was
              running in high gear after every seminar. My favorite moment of
              the day was walking home after classes, the city bathed
              in the golden light of the setting sun and a stream of new ideas
              pouring through my mind in rapid succession.</p>

<!-- TODO: Fill out/clarify this transition -->
            <p class="maintext">Yet beneath my pursuit of philosophy, there where
               deep fault lines, namely, false assumptions about the discipline
               and problematic motives for pursuing it as a profession; soon,
              the effects of these fault lines began to show on the surface of
              my life.
              The academic life was not what I'd thought it would be.
               Instead of spending my time learning about interesting subjects
               through deep discussions with friends, I found myself sitting
               alone, reading about
               technical issues seven steps of abstraction removed from
               anything I cared about and learning next to nothing. The reasons
               for this are a complex of hyperspecialization and the publish-or-
               perish atmosphere, which have the effect that people think about
               what they can publish on, not what they care about; that people
               can rarely have productive conversations, as even other
               philosophers likely don't
               have a sufficient grasp of one's area of research to speak
               meaningfully about it; and that one must read and write so much,
               that it is difficult to maintain one's health and friendships.
               Magnifying all this is a professional culture in which everyone
               reads a few big names in each subdiscipline, while the work of
               most philosophers goes unread and unappreciated. Since the
               undergrads one teaches
               by and large do not care about the subject, this means that for
               most academic philosophers, most of their work seems to them to
               be either underappreciated (leading to bitterness) or unworthy
               (leading to low self-worth). I felt like I was
               spinning my wheels, only digging myself deeper in a hole of doubt
                and confusion, multiplying and sophisticating the questions, but
               getting no closer to answering them---and on top of this entering
               a career that promised what seemed to me to be a fairly pathetic
               existence.
               All this was compounded by a serious case of imposter syndrome, by
               my best friend and climbing partner moving away, and by my wife
               going through a difficult career transition. Taken together,
               these factors led me to a very dark place. I woke up every day
               and hoped I'd be sick so I could just stay home. I tried to avoid
                seeing anyone from my department because I was ashamed that I
                was struggling. I couldn't break out of negative patterns
                 of thought and felt like a complete failure. My life
                 seemed to be falling apart and I had a hard time believing
                 things would ever get better.</p>

                 <p>I think the first fault line was so destructive in part
                   because of the second. I told myself I was pursuing the truth
                   for its own sake, simply because I found the questions
                   interesing and the study rewarding. But I think I was also,
                   perhaps mostly, motivated by a desire to be the guy with the
                   answers. I've always succeeded academically and that has been
                   the thing I've received the most praise and recognition for.
                   Somehow, I got to the point where my identity as a smart
                   person, as someone who knows, was my only identity or at least
                    my most fundamental identity. As I came to realize how much
                    I did not know, especially about such important questions, I
                    began to feel a need, a compulsion to find the answers. After
                    all, I was the guy who knows things, the guy with answers.
                    If there were important questions that I couldn't answer,
                    then who was I? Why would anyone find me interesting or
                    worthwhile? This compulsion brought on by the conflict
                    between my identity on the one hand, and the reality of my
                    ignorance and inability to remove it on the other, magnified
                    the normal stressors of graduate school and led me to have
                    unrealistic expectations of what it would be like to be a
                    professional philosopher. Every stupid question, every bad
                    paper, every new realization of how much I didn't understand
                    was not just a part of the normal growing pains of a young
                    philosopher; it was a challenge to my conception of myself
                    and my value as a person.</p>

                 <h4><em>3.2. And Back Again</em></h4>
                 <!-- TODO: Finish editing text below here -->
                 <p class="maintext">Sometimes we have to hit rock bottom before
                   we can give up our false beliefs and incorrect values, or
                   even see that we have them. I finally got to the
                    point where I knew something had to give and I had to admit
                    to myself that my pursuit of philosophy was not a noble
                    pursuit of truth for truth's sake. This insight into my true
                    motives and misconceptions was one part of a radical shift
                    in perspective that has helped me climb back out of the pit
                    of despair. The other key factor was experiencing real love
                    and belonging through my wife and her family.</p>
                  <p class="maintext">My parents were good to me and raised me
                  pretty well. I was a well-behaved, conscientious kid and a
                good student and I didn't make any enormously bad decisions as a
                teen. But I never really learned how to love people. The exact
              reasons for this are not clear to me, and I do not have the space
              to explore them here anyway, but whatever the reasons, my siblings
              and my parents and I were not close. Because we did not have a
              healthy family polis (so to speak), I was very self-focused. I
              generally acted in a kind way towards others because I knew it was
              the right thing to do, but I didn't experience a deep sense of
              empathy for others, at least not usually. There was a central,
              phenomenological aspect of love that was absent. Perhaps you could
              say that I acted for the good of others out of duty, rather than
              desire. My love was an intellectualist, rather than a holistic,
              personal sort of love.</p>
              <p>My wife comes from a boisterous Italian family that really
                knows how to love. They're a bit rough around the edges, maybe
                not so good at strict adherence to rules, but they deeply care
                about others and want the good for them. They might let their
                emotions flare a bit more, but they convey such a sense of grace
                 and acceptance that when they argue or wrong one another, it
                 never fractures the relationship, but actually strengthens it.
                 As I spent a few summers and many holidays with this incredible
                 family, I began to see the value of the domestic life for the
                 first time and I began to see the world as a member of this
                 family. As I grew closer to my
                 wife, I also began to see the world as a husband and (aspiring)
                 father. That is to say, being a member of this family and being
                 a husband and (aspiring) father became a part of my practical
                 identity, a part of how I saw myself, a part of what generated
                 and structured my desires. As these new identities developed
                 and my old identity faded, I realized that I no longer wanted a
                 career in philosophy for three reasons:
                   <ol>
                     <li>The academic life was not a good fit for my skills and
                       interests.</li>
                     <li>The academic life would very likely not allow my wife
                       and I to raise our (future) kids near family.</li>
                    <li>The academic life would not allow us to contribute to
                      our families/care for our relatives as they age.</li>
                   </ol>
                 In light of these reasons, I decided to walk away from
                 philosophy and pursue a career that would have more concrete
                 results/feedback and direct benefits to others, as well as one
                 with better pay and greater control over where I would live.</p>
                 <p>Based on these criteria plus my background and skills in
                 argumentation and analysis, law seemed a natural fit. But, I
                 knew a couple of guys who work in software development and they
                 suggested that I look into that as well. After reasearching a
                 bit, I decided to apply to LaunchCode and try to work as a
                 programmer for a year before law school for a number of reasons:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Coding is intrinsically interesting.</li>
                      <li>Coding will open up opportunities in IP law and the
                        emerging legal tech field.</li>
                      <li>It would be great if I could get a good job and not
                        have to go to school for three more years (and thus
                        delay having kids) or take on debt.</li>

                 <p class="maintext">About two years into my graduate program, I began to realize that
                 the academic life was not for me. I didn't have the scholar's
                 drive to devote my life to giving a systematic answer to a small
                 question. I didn't even enjoy teaching philosophy, at least as it
                 is done in the university setting. And I had begun to think about
                 things not from the unencumbered and uncommitted position of a
                 single person with no debt and no real relationship with his
                 family, but from the pressing position of a husband, a future
                 father, and a member of a real, loving family. My wife's family
                 took me in as their own and showed me what a beautiful thing a
                 good family is. I had come to see that much of what I was seeking
                 in philosophy was trying to fill a relational or communal void in
                 my life and also that the sort of career I could plausibly look
                 forward to in academia (if any) would not allow me to live up to
                 my duties as a member of my wife's family, nor would it allow me
                 and my wife to achieve our desires for our own family. We felt we
                 would need to contribute to the care of some of the aging members
                 of her family in the near future, and we wanted to raise our
                 kids around their extended family. Thus, we realized that we
                 needed a better income and more control over job location than a
                 career in philosophy could promise. So, I began exploring other
                 options. Law was a logical shift, as the skills of analysis and
                 argumentation that one learns in philosophy directly translate to
                 the practice of law.</p>


                 <p class="maintext">But I knew a couple of people who work in
                 software engineering, one of whom left philosophy to do so, and
                 they encouraged me to look into coding. The more I learned about
                 what coding involved, the more interested I became. Now that I've
                 been learning to code for a few weeks, I am hooked. I love the
                 concreteness of functions and programs. They work or they don't
                 and you can tell when they don't.
                 And if they don't, you know there is a way to fix them. It's fun
                 to learn something and then be able to apply it to make or do
                 something that I couldn't before. Moreover, it is satisfying to
                 be learning something that others may actually find useful and
                 to be learning something where it is clear how to get better.
                 In coding, if you want to get better, you can find tutorials,
                 work on a project, and generally just practice making programs.
                 In philosophy, it is not so clear how to improve. Reading good
                 thinkers and writing your thoughts out as clearly as possible
                 and trying to give valid arguments for key claims helps, but
                 it's no guarantee of actually getting anywhere.</p>

                 <p class="maintext">After completing LC101, I'm hoping to get
                   placed in an apprenticeship in Saint Louis, that turns into a
                    real programming job for the next year. I'm still planning
                    to go to law school after that, but I have become convinced
                    that the legal field is on the brink of being revolutionized
                    through software. I think the
                   <a class="body_links" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFGOcz57QB8"
                    target="_blank">legal tech</a> field holds promise of
                    financial reward, stimulating work, and the chance to make the
                    world a significantly more just place
                    (<a class="body_links" href="http://fakenous.net/?p=196"
                    target="_blank">Michael Huemer</a> has
                    convinced me that the cost of legal services is, to my mind,
                     the most serious injustice in our society today). So,
                     I'm hoping that I
                    get to keep coding and help bring cheaper
                    and better legal service to more people.</p> <!-- maybe add stuff
                      about how the bail project and Mike Huemer's blog helped
                      you see that the cost of legal services/the inadequate
                      provision of them is perhaps THE central injustice of our
                      society --> <p class="maintext">The journey to this place was difficult,
                      painful, and disorienting, yet full of beauty and insight
                      and growth---that is to say, it's been an adventure. And
                     like all great adventures, you never know exactly what lies
                   ahead. </p>
